If you are already used to build <strong>Games</strong> or <strong>Applications</strong> with libraries like PixiJS, BabylonJS, no new API to learn ... you will feel at home.</p><p>Let&#39;s see each point individually</p><h2 id="\u{1F680}-project-boostrap" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F680}-project-boostrap" aria-hidden="true">#</a> \u{1F680} Project Boostrap</h2><p>Starting a new project is usually really time consuming when working on web projects.</p><ul><li>Lot of possible Libraries</li><li>Lot of configurations and incompatibilities</li><li>Lot of knowledge required</li></ul><p><strong>Pixel Builder</strong> comes with a set of questions and pre-configure the project for your needs.</p><p>You can start working on your game in minutes without having to worry about the setup or configuration files.

Dealing with Assets</h3><p>Dealing with assets is always a challenge for games, but more specifically with web games.</p><p>Games often require quick iterations, and a ton of assets. Which lead to unused or duplicated assets, that are slowing down the project and making the build grow.</p><p><strong>Pixel Builder</strong> will help you with most common tasks</p><ul><li>cleaning asset folder</li><li>generating spritesheet</li><li>image optimization, resize</li><li>audio optimization</li></ul><p>Our goal is to provide you tools to simplify your life.</p><p>No crazy dependencies or GUI app to manually install, just use our asset manifest to explicit your needs and we get you covered.</p><h2 id="\u{1F4E6}-build" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F4E6}-build" aria-hidden="true">#</a> \u{1F4E6} Build</h2><p>Finally and maybe the most important one, the build pipeline.</p><p>Anyone who already spend hours fighting with webpack, gulp or babel will be please to know they have nothing to do.
