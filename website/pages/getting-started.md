# Getting Started

## Install our CLI

To get started, run the following to get our CLI tools:

```sh
yarn global add @pixel-builder/cli

# or npn users
$ npm i -g @pixel-builder/cli
```

## Create a New Pixel Project

From there, you can create a new project

```sh
pixel create ProjectName
```

You will be asked few questions about what kind of project and options you would like.

Then when it's done

```sh
# open your project
cd ProjectName

# run in develop
yarn dev

# or build it
yarn build
```

For more informations, check the **./README.md** at the root of your new project
