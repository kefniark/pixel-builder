# Folder Structure

## Description

The folder structure is quite standard for a vue project and quite minimal

- `public/`: Everything in this folder will be copied over to the build (favicon, robot.txt, ...)
- `src/`:
  - `assets/`: For game assets (strip and optimized)
  - `scenes/`: Vue files for pages
  - `app.vue`: The main layout of the application
  - `index.html`: The base HTML of the app
  - `index.ts`: Bootstrap of the app
- `package.json`: The manifest of the project
